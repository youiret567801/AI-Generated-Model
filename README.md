# Markov Chain AI Discord Bot

This README file provides an overview of a Discord bot powered by a Markov chain-based AI. The bot learns from server conversations and dynamically adapts its responses based on user feedback.

## Description

This Discord bot utilizes a Markov chain algorithm to generate novel sentences based on the messages it observes in a Discord server. The core of the bot's functionality is its ability to learn from the communication patterns of the users, creating a unique personality that reflects the server's culture and inside jokes.

The bot actively participates in conversations, and its responses are generated by analyzing the sequence of words in the messages it has processed. This results in responses that can range from surprisingly coherent and contextually relevant to amusingly nonsensical.

## How it Works

### Training Data: Discord Messages

The bot's intelligence is derived from its training data, which consists entirely of messages sent by users in the Discord server. The process involves:

1.  **Message Collection:** The bot passively reads and stores messages from designated channels. This creates a large corpus of text that represents the conversational style of the server.
2.  **Markov Chain Model:** This corpus is then used to build a Markov chain model. A Markov chain is a mathematical model that describes a sequence of events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state of the system at the previous event. In this context, the "events" are words in a sentence. The model builds a probabilistic map of which words are likely to follow other words or sequences of words.

### Active Learning and User Feedback

A key feature of this bot is its ability to learn and refine its responses in real-time through user interaction and feedback.

1.  **Active Response:** Once the initial model is built, the bot can start generating its own messages. It can be triggered by being mentioned or by a specific command.
2.  **Message Rating System:** After the bot sends a message, users can rate its quality. This is typically implemented using reactions (e.g., emojis like üëç for a good response and üëé for a bad one).
3.  **Reinforcement:** This user feedback is then used to reinforce the bot's learning process.
    * **Positive Ratings:** Messages that receive positive ratings will have their underlying word sequences strengthened in the Markov chain model. This increases the probability that similar phrases or sentence structures will be used in the future.
    * **Negative Ratings:** Conversely, negatively rated messages will have their corresponding word sequence probabilities weakened, making it less likely for the bot to generate similar outputs.

This continuous feedback loop allows the bot to adapt and improve over time, tailoring its responses to the preferences of the server members.

### AI to AI Interaction

For testing and to generate a diverse range of initial training data, another AI chatbot, **qwen3**, was used to interact with this bot. This provided a large volume of conversational text to help build the initial Markov chain model before introducing it to human users.

## Running the Bot

To get the bot up and running, follow these steps:

1.  **Configure Settings:** Open the `config.json` file and enter your bot's token and any other required settings.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal in the project directory and run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the Bot:** After the installation is complete, start the bot with:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
