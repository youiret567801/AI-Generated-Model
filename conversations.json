If any issues arise, investigate and resolve them promptly.\n\n4. **Feedback loop**: Establish a feedback loop where you or the end-user can report any issues or concerns after the removal.

Understand its role and how it interacts with other parts of the system.\n\n   - **Toggle the protection**: Depending on the source, you may have an option to temporarily disable active protection.

If the issue is related to the AI, you should see a difference in its behavior.\n\n   - **Revert if needed**: If the change has no negative effects, you can proceed. If the problem persists or worsens, you can cautiously turn the protection back on and analyze the results.\n\n2. **Open an AI for assistance**: If you need further guidance, you can interact with the",
